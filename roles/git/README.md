Role Name
=========

Ansible role to configure git and pull down additional repositories.

Requirements
------------

In order to clone private repositories, a private SSH key must be generated and its public keypair added to your Github profile.

Role Variables
--------------

The following variables are set in /vars/main.yml and should not be changed:
```yml
git_required_pkgs_debian:
  - git

git_config_files:
  - .gitconfig
  - .gitignore
  - .gitconfig.local
```

The git_key_file variable is set in defaults/main.yml and can be overridden in the global scope:
```yml
git_key_file: "{{ kali_user_details.home }}/.ssh/id_rsa"
```

The git_repos and private_repos variable lists should be set in the global scope, as desired. The default branch to clone is 'master', this can be optionally overridden as seen below:
```yml
git_repos:
  - dest: /opt/BloodHound
    repo: https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound.git

private_repos:
  - dest: "{{ kali_user_details.home }}/Projects/Project_A
    repo: https://github.com/borari/private_project_repo.git
    version: main
```

    - git
```
