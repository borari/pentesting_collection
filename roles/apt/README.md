Role Name
=========

This role configures the `apt` package manager.

Requirements
------------

This role will only execute on systems that report `apt` as their package manager during the gathering of ansible_facts.

Role Variables
--------------

The default list for all variables is empty.

The `apt_packages` list is defined in the global scope, and should contain a list of the apt packages you want installed on the target hosts.

```yml
    apt_packages:
      - curl
      - netcat
      - net-tools
      ...
```

The `add_repos` list is defined in the global scope, and each item should contain the PPA Key URL and PPA repo URL.

```yml
    add_repos:
      - ppa: deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode stable main
        ppa_key: https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
```

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: kali
      roles:
         - apt
