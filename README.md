# Ansible Collection - borari.pentesting_ansible_collection

## Playbooks
An example `site.yml` and `kali.yml` playbook has been provided in `playbooks/`.
This collection was created in order to quickly rebuild a Kali VM image, so the playbooks are built with running against the Kali VM localhost in mind.
Each task requiring sudo has been set with become:yes directly, it is not needed in the playbook.
Playbook should be run in the context of the user that will be using Kali, not as an ansible-specific user.
