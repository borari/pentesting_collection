# Ansible Collection: borari.pentesting_collection


This collection was created in order to quickly rebuild a Kali VM image, so the playbooks are built with running against the Kali VM localhost in mind.

Each task requiring sudo has been set with become:yes directly, it does not need to be declared at a playbook level.

## Playbooks

An example `site.yml` and `kali.yml` playbook has been provided in `playbooks/`, along with a sample inventory setting the host group [kali] to 127.0.0.1.

## Thanks

[iesplin](https://github.com/iesplin) for the Burp Suite role, and the initial work of creating the ansible-playbook-kali playbook, without which this project would not have been possible.
